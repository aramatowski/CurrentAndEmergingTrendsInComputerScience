**What work did I complete on this project?**
For this project, I created an intelligent system that can learn to successfully complete the Treasure Hunt game with a 100% success rate. 
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists use computers and technology to solve a great range of problems. Almost all industries currently rely on software and technology to function efficiently. Computer scientists work with anything ranging from scientific research, to developing space exploration equipment, to creating games and leisure activities for users all by creating functioning code to meet the demands of their customers.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
As a computer scientist, I first approach a problem by making sure that I thoroughly understand what the problem is. This includes reading over all requirements for the project and why those requirements are important. Next, I begin planning how that problem should be solved. Finally, I begin coding my program, checking for errors as I go and working through them. Once the code is finished and I have checked for functionality through testing, I submit the project.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
The most important ethical responsibility I must comply to is that I will not create a program that causes harm to others. I also have an ethical responsibility to create secure code that can protect personal information. I also, must be sure to understand and comply with any rules and regulations that apply to each program I create.
